## Mission Statement

Zones was created as an easy way to share impulse response recordings. Typically good quality
libraries and plugins are expensive and finding free IR's is difficult.

Our aim is to simplify the process so that not only is there a range of Zones neatly collected, but
using them practically in the DAW is easy. This simplifies the workflow and lowers the entry barrier
of using IR's greatly as anyone with the plugin installed can access all zones without leaving
the DAW.

Zones has also been designed to be flexible in a number or use cases, such as for a pop mixing engineer
to add nice sounding reverb to a different instruments, a classical engineer who wants to the sound
of their favourite concert hall or a post-production mixer who wants to add realistic room reverb to
ADR voices. Impulse responses can also be used beyond reverb to mix sounds together creatively.

Zones has been developed with zero budget and is completely free for users.
