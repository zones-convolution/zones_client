# Introduction

Zones is a free convolution reverb plugin that allows you to download samples of real-world spaces
to use directly in a DAW. These spaces, also known as impulse responses, are recorded and uploaded by users.
Via a process called convolution, these impulse responses can be used to make it sound like your input is
being recorded in that space in real-time. This is perfect for a variety of uses, such as transforming a
dry piano recording to a large concert hall, matching reverb for ADR vocals with on-set recordings in
post-production, or creative purposes with interesting synthesised impulse responses.

# What is a Zone?

A Zone can be described as a collection of recordings of a particular space at a particular time.
It can be composed of one or many different IR recordings with a range of speaker positions, microphone
positions and microphone types.

For example, I could record an IR at a concert hall with three speaker positions on the stage
(left, centre and right). One IR might be a spaced pair of omni mics using the left and right speaker
positions for a true stereo recording. I might then move the mics onto the balcony to create a more
distant sounding pair. Finally, I could place an ambisonic mic in the middle of the hall and use the
centre speaker to make a soundfield recording of the hall.

This idea can be expanded beyond concerts halls, such as different spots in a cave, rooms in a house
or settings on a hardware reverb unit.

However, there could be a variety of reasons to describe recordings as separate zones. For example, if
someone else recorded the same hall their own way, or if I decided to re-record the same hall on a
different day with new techniques and mic placements. In this way, a zone could be described as an 'event'
where recordings were made, rather than exclusively the geographic location. However, zones are linked
to a specific location or hardware unit or synth in that a single zone isn't a collection of kitchen
recordings or a range of cathedrals.

Ultimately, there isn't a hard rule for zones, and it should be down to the user to share their
recordings in the easiest format for everyone to use!

# Getting Started / Workflow example

## Basic Usage

To get started, add zones onto the effects chain of your chosen channel in the DAW. You'll see that there
are three tabs, *Browse*, *Edit* and *Preferences*. Head to *Browse* and you should find a range of zones to use.
You can browse by selecting a category, searching for a specific term or using a previously downloaded one.
CLicking the play button will select a compatible IR, or alternatively click the eye button to see all the
IR's in that zone and select from there.

Selecting an IR will save the IR to your machine's disk and load it in the plugin. From here you can move
to the *Edit* tab to see the IR as a spectrogram and adjust the parameters (*See Parameter Guide*).

## Workflow Example

Say you had a dry stereo piano recording that you wanted to sound nicer. In the *Browse* tab, search for
the *York Minster* zone and click the eye to see the full details. Here you can see details about the
space and its recording. You can experiment with the different mic placements depending on whether you
want the piano to sound close or far. Before selecting the IR, ensure true stereo is selected using
the ... next to the IR. This will perform more convolution creating a richer and more realistic sounding
reverb and stereo image.

Next head to the *Edit* tab and set Dry/Wet mix to 100% wet, because the IR will already contain the direct signal.
Using the spectrogram, you can edit parameters to fine-tune the sound of the reverb, such as using the trim
to remove any gap at the start, or reverb time to reduce the tail length.
